  <h2>Calisthenics</h2>
  <p>Calisthenics (American English) or callisthenics
    (Commonwealth English) are exercises consisting of a variety
    of gross motor movements—running, standing, grasping, pushing,
    etc. — often performed rhythmically and with minimal equipment,
    so essentially, bodyweight exercises. They are intended to increase
    body strength, body fitness, and flexibility, through movements
    such as pulling or pushing oneself up, bending, jumping, or
    swinging, using only one's body weight for resistance; usually
    conducted in concert with stretches. When performed vigorously and
    with variety, calisthenics can provide the benefits of muscular
    and aerobic conditioning, in addition to improving psychomotor skills
    such as balance, agility and coordination. Many consider
    calisthenics as "movement through space", meaning you can move
    freely without any restriction blocking your full strength.</p>

  <P style="margin-top:40px;"><strong>Push-ups are a <u>basic exercise</u></strong> used in
  civilian athletic training or physical education and commonly
  in military physical training. They are also a common form of punishment
  used in the military, school sport, or in some martial arts disciplines</P>
